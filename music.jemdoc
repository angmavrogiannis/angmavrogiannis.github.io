In my free time, I play the guitar and compose rock and rap music. I produce music using *[https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/ FL Studio]* and *[https://new.steinberg.net/cubase/ Cubase]*. I often try to include my musical compositions into my course projects at Carnegie Mellon University. Here is a *[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CnRe0rtnys halloween themed demo]* I created for the individual project of 24-780: Engineering Computation for the fall 2018 semester. The video is created using an OpenGL *[http://ysflight.in.coocan.jp/programming/fssimplewindow/e.html rendering library]* in C\+\+ and the music is written and recorded by me. *[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IRqu0saWe8 This]* is a video recorded for the project course *[https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/amj1/classes/robotdesign.html 24-775: Robot Design & Experimentation]* with music I wrote and recorded especially for this project (more in the *[projects.html projects]* section). You can listen to some more of my music *[https://soundcloud.com/blackjawn here]*.
