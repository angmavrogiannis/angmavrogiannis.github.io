In my free time, I play the guitar and compose rock and rap music. I produce music using *[https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/ FL Studio]* and *[https://new.steinberg.net/cubase/ Cubase]*. You can listen to some more of my music *[https://soundcloud.com/blackjawn here]*. In the past, I was a member of two rock/metal bands, composing original songs and performing on stage regularly. 
\nHere are some music videos of songs we have written:\n
