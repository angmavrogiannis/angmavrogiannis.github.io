I developed a DRL framework for multi-constraint automatic bidding towards optimizing the LinkedIn Ads platform. The framework was built upon OpenAI gym, using synthetic data to simulate a 2nd price auction real-time bidding environment. This project was the stepping stone for a DRL-based system that was subsequently used in production for automatic bidding at LinkedIn.
