We developed a framework on Visual Basic that receives mathematical expressions as input, analyzes them using a suitable parser, and optimizes them with genetic algorithms. The parser allows the input of the expressions in string format and distinguishes the variables, the parameters and the operational symbols. Besides the equations, the user can choose between a set of genetic algorithms for the optimization, as well as the hyperparameters. The implemented software was tested and validated on two applications: the minimization of the forces applied onto an object grasped by a robotic arm and the maximization of the stiffness of a cantilever beam.
