 My summer 2023 intern project introduced open-source generative AI in the current LinkedIn audience targeting pipeline. I used Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source Large Language Models, quantitatively compared them and identified the best performing task-specific model. Fine-tuning this model, I outperformed the existing baseline used in production for automatic audience targeting in user-defined advertising campaigns.
