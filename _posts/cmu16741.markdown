Collected a synthetic dataset of manipulator postures and object poses in OpenAI Gym. Trained a multilayer perceptron in order to map changes in hand pose to object displacements. Modified the OpenAI Gym simulator to demonstrate the predicted object pose and validated the method on occluded object tracking problems.
