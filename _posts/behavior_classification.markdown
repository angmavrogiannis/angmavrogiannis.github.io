We extract high-level features from raw vehicle trajectory data and classify drivers into behavioral classes based on their level of aggressiveness. We demonstrate how the identification of a driver's behavior improves the accuracy of the short-term trajectory prediction problem by introducing a prior knowledge on their behavior.
