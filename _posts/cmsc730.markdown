Proposed and led a group project on building a 3D-printed chessboard-resembling racetrack and an interactive system that converts it to a VRsimulated racing environment. Implemented the computer vision module, tracking the position and orientation of the pieces using ArUco markers and mapping them to poses and ego-vehicle control commands in a simulated racetrack in Unity.
