== About Me
I am a second-year master's student in the department of *[https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/ Mechanical Engineering]* at *[https://www.cmu.edu/ Carnegie Mellon University]*. My interests lie in the fields of robotics and machine learning. I am currently working on vehicle behavior prediction, advised by Prof. *[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cliu6/ Changliu Liu]* at the *[https://icontrol.ri.cmu.edu/ Intelligent Control Lab]* in the Robotics Institute. Prior to that, I received my diploma in *[https://www.mead.upatras.gr/en/ Mechanical Engineering and Aeronautics]* from the *[https://www.upatras.gr/en University of Patras]* (Greece). For my diploma thesis, I worked with Prof. *[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Argyris_Dentsoras Argyris Dentsoras]* on the development of a *[https://github.com/angmavrogiannis/Diploma-Thesis framework]* for automatic parsing of optimization problems.

\n\nHere is my *{{<a href="docs/Mavrogiannis_extended_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>}}*.\n
