== About Me
I am a second-year master's student in the department of *[https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/ Mechanical Engineering]* at *[https://www.cmu.edu/ Carnegie Mellon University]*. I am broadly interested in the development of planning, estimation and learning algorithms applied in robotics. I am a member of *[http://icontrol.ri.cmu.edu/ Intelligent Control Lab]* in the Robotics Institute and my thesis is focused on vehicle behavior prediction, advised by Prof. *[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cliu6/ Changliu Liu]*. Prior to that, I received my diploma in *[https://www.mead.upatras.gr/en/ Mechanical Engineering and Aeronautics]* from the *[https://www.upatras.gr/en University of Patras]* (Greece). For my diploma thesis, I worked with Prof. *[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Argyris_Dentsoras Argyris Dentsoras]* on the development of a *[https://github.com/angmavrogiannis/Diploma-Thesis framework]* for automatic parsing and solution of optimization problems formulated in structured language.

\n\nHere is my *{{<a href="docs/Mavrogiannis_extended_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>}}*.\n
