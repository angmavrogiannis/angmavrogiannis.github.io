== About Me
I am a first-year master's student in the department of *[https://www.cs.umd.edu Computer Science]* at *[https://www.umd.edu University of Maryland]*. I am broadly interested in the development of planning, estimation and learning algorithms applied in robotics. Prior to this, I received a Master of Science in *[https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/ Mechanical Engineering]* from *[https://www.cmu.edu/ Carnegie Mellon University]*. At CMU, I was a member of the *[http://icontrol.ri.cmu.edu/ Intelligent Control Lab]* in the Robotics Institute and my thesis focused on vehicle behavior prediction, advised by Prof. *[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cliu6/ Changliu Liu]*. Prior to CMU, I received my diploma (BS & MEng) in *[https://www.mead.upatras.gr/en/ Mechanical Engineering and Aeronautics]* from the *[https://www.upatras.gr/en University of Patras]* (Greece). For my diploma thesis, I worked with Prof. *[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Argyris_Dentsoras Argyris Dentsoras]* on the development of a *[https://github.com/angmavrogiannis/Diploma-Thesis framework]* for automatic parsing and solution of optimization problems formulated in structured language.
